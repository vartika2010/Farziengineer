Ashutosh & Gaurav first came in as consultants and stabilize our previous website so that we can run business smoothly on older stack. Within 3 months, they launched a new website which has the capability to handle at 10x traffic of previous one and with a lot more features. Soon after optimization, we were able to increase our conversion rates and hence our CAC starting going down. Running business had become much smoother and efficient. I would like to recommend Farzi engineers to growing D2C brands and look forward to working with them in future projects. Keep up the good work.</p>
